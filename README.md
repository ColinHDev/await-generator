# await-generator
A library to use async/await in PHP using generators.

Documentation available in [Await.php](await-generator/src/SOFe/AwaitGenerator/Await.php).

A quick comparison between a class written in traditional callback-async pattern (leading to the infamous callback hell) and one written in the await-generator pattern: [CallbackHellControl.php](tests/virion_tests/SOFe/AwaitGenerator/CallbackHellControl.php) vs [AwaitTest.php](tests/virion_tests/SOFe/AwaitGenerator/AwaitTest.php).
